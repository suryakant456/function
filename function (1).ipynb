        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and ease of use. Its popularity stems from its versatility, extensive libraries, and a large, supportive community, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including web development, data science, and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  -In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, allowing you to see the results immediately. Unlike compilers, which translate code into machine code before execution, interpreters translate and execute code at runtime.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   -Python keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings and purposes within the language. They cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). These keywords are integral to Python's syntax and control the flow and structure of code execution. The number of keywords may vary slightly between Python versions, but a common list includes\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   In Python, pre-defined keywords (often just called keywords) are reserved words that have special meaning to the Python interpreter. You cannot use them as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names) because they are part of the language syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  -Mutability in Python refers to whether or not an object’s state (its contents) can be changed after it’s created.\n",
        "  Performance and memory: Immutable types can be cached and used safely in concurrent environments.\n",
        "  Function behavior: Mutating an object passed to a function affects the original; this doesn't happen with immutable types.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  -The key reason why lists are mutable and tuples are immutable in Python lies in design choices and intended use cases:\n",
        "  I. Design Philosophy:\n",
        "  Lists are designed to be flexible collections for general-purpose use, where elements often need to be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "  Tuples are meant to be fixed collections, often used for grouping data (like records or coordinates), where modification is not expected or desired.\n",
        " II. Implementation Details:\n",
        "  Lists are implemented to allow in-place changes: you can change items, resize the list, etc. This means their internal data structure supports dynamic memory allocation.\n",
        "  Tuples are implemented as fixed-size structures. Once created, their memory layout doesn’t support item reassignment or resizing.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "  -In Python, == and is are not the same—they serve different purposes:\n",
        "  == → Equality Operator\n",
        "  Checks if two values are equal (i.e., they have the same content).\n",
        "  Compares values.\n",
        "  is → Identity Operator\n",
        "  Checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "  Compares object identity (i.e., same memory address).\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  -Logical operators in Python are used to combine or modify boolean values. These operators evaluate expressions and return a boolean result (True or False). Python has three main logical operators: and, or, and not.\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        " -Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing a variable's data type to another. In Python, this can be done explicitly using built-in functions or implicitly by the interpreter.\n",
        " Explicit type casting requires the programmer to manually convert the data type using functions like int(), float(), and str(). This is useful when a specific data type is needed for an operation or function.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  -Implicit type casting, also known as widening or coercion, is the automatic conversion of one data type to another, typically from a smaller data type to a larger one, performed by the compiler. Explicit type casting, on the other hand, is a manual conversion where the programmer specifies the desired data type, often involving a potential loss of data or precision.\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  -Conditional statements in Python enable programs to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on whether specific conditions are met. They control the flow of execution, allowing programs to respond dynamically to varying inputs and situations. The primary conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  -The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  -The primary difference between for and while loops lies in when the number of iterations is known beforehand. for loops are best suited for situations where you know exactly how many times the loop will execute, often when iterating over a collection or sequence. while loops, on the other hand, are more flexible and used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a dynamic condition.\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "  -In programming, for loops are best used when you know the number of iterations ahead of time, whereas a while loop is best used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance. Both methods can help you iterate through your code."
